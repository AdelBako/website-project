	    <p><h2><span style="font-weight: bold">Meet Era</span></h2></p>
	    <p>It wasn’t until I started my health coach training program at the Institute of Integrative Nutrition (IIN) that I finally discovered what being healthy means to me.  I struggled for years with disordered eating, insomnia, depression, anxiety, body shaming and never feeling enough despite my efforts to eat a nutritious diet and exercise regularly.  As a student at IIN, I learned that health is so much more than food and exercise; it encompasses everything that nourishes the body on and off of the plate. 
<br>
			<br>
			
		As I peeled back the layers of my health, I realized that being healthy is not about following a rigid diet or hitting my goal weight, it’s about listening to my body and treating myself with compassion. I slowly started letting go of my need to be perfect and allowed myself to indulge in all of my heart's desires.  Lo and behold, I began to heal. I started eating what I wanted without shame, I started sleeping through the night, I started loving myself deeply and I started smiling brighter than ever. 
<br>
			<br>
		My goal as a health coach is to support my clients in finding their own unique version of balance.  I am here to offer positive encouragement and tips on how to live a wildly healthy life, filled with fun and free of rules. 
<br>
